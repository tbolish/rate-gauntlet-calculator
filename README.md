About The Project
This tool was built to demystify the complex and often misunderstood costs associated with hiring labor in the United States. It goes beyond simple hourly rates to provide a comprehensive financial analysis from two critical perspectives: the total cost to the hiring entity and the final take-home pay for the worker.

By allowing users to model scenarios across different states and under various legal classifications (W-2, 1099 Sole Proprietor, 1099 S-Corp), The Rate Gauntlet empowers both businesses and independent workers to make more informed financial decisions.

Key Features
Multi-State Calculation Engine: Accurately models W-2 employer costs based on state-specific laws for overtime, state unemployment (SUI), paid family leave (PFML/SDI), and paid sick leave (PSL). Currently supports California, Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.

Three-Way Scenario Comparison: Directly compares the net financial outcomes for a worker classified as a W-2 Employee, a 1099 Sole Proprietor, and a 1099 S-Corp Owner.

Interactive Timecard: Users can add or remove days and input daily hours to see how different work schedules affect pay and costs.

Dynamic Workweek Adjustment: Instantly see how changing the official start of the workweek impacts weekly overtime and 7th-day rule calculations.

Detailed Expense Modeling: Allows contractors and S-Corp owners to itemize their annual business expenses (insurance, fees, software, etc.) for a more accurate net pay calculation.

Transparent Breakdowns: Uses interactive charts and tooltips to clearly explain how every number is calculated, from overtime premiums to payroll tax liabilities.

Source-Verified Data: All state-specific rules are based on and link directly to official Department of Labor or government websites.

How to Use
The simulator is designed to be intuitive. Adjust the inputs in the "Simulator" section to see all charts and calculations update in real-time.

Select State: Choose the state of employment to load its specific labor laws.

Set Hourly Rates: Use the sliders or input boxes to set the base hourly rates for both a W-2 employee and a 1099 contractor.

Define Work Schedule: Use the "Interactive Timecard" to input the hours worked for each day of the project.

Adjust Workweek: Change the "Workweek Start Day" to see how it affects overtime calculations.

Model Contractor Scenarios:

Set the hourly thresholds for custom 1099 Overtime/Double Time rules.

For the S-Corp model, enter the annual "reasonable salary" you pay yourself.

Use the "Business Expenses" section to either enter a simple percentage or itemize your annual costs for a more accurate net pay calculation.
